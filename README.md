<h1>EMAIL SUBSCRIPTION PAGE</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  This Page is basically created to get the Email-ID's of all the users that are interested to get updates regarding our recent developments as well as for those who are interested for the launch of our new website.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Outcomes of the project</h2> 
<ul>
  <li>In this page I have used the concepts from basics of HTML, CSS & JavaScript.</li>
  <li>The main purpose to create this project was to learn about the real-life applications of these concepts of HTML, CSS & JavaScript.</li>
  <li>This Project also helped me understand why it is better to write HTML, CSS & JavaScript(For better readability, reusability & convenience)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Files Used</h2>
<h3>index.html</h3>
<p>
  The index.html file is used to add/show up all the text on the display. In this file I have also added the HTML Form Elements(here, input & button). In this file we have also written the script that is responsible to store the input taken from user and store it in the Google Sheets named <b>"Email List"</b>.
</p>
<h3>style.css</h3>
<p>
  This style.css file is used to add style to the dull HTML tags and present them in a better manner to the user. In this file we have set the positioning of the text to left, set sizes of input box and button, added a background image & lots more.

    Also, in the upcoming phases we will try to make the layout of the website more simplistic and minimal(i.e., we would like to work upon our frontend & would like to make it more professional).
